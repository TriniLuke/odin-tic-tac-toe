  "description": "This project was very difficult because we had to build the game using IIFEs. This was a new way of coding and it took me about 25 hours to get used to coding in this way. I was able to learn how to call and initialize IIFEs and how to properly use factory functions. This project was really fun and I am happy and excited to have learned about these concepts.",
